**Documentation elbeFrontend**
	
elbeFrontend is a desktop application to manage and use elbe-rfs. The idea is to make things easier when using elbe, especially for people who are not comfortable using a terminal.

Features:
* create projects (in initVM and as elbefrontend Project) 
* create, import and edit elbe XML files
* validate XML files against the dbsfed.xsd from elbe
* build projects (using elbe as outside process)
* download files from initVM
* delete projects (from initVM and filesystem)


First Steps:
* At first you are asked to specify an elbe and an initVM 
* to create a new project go to *File->New->New Project*, fill the wizard and confirm
* to add a xml file to your project you can either import one by going to *File->Import* or create a new one by going to *File->New->New* XML
* you can now edit the xml in the editor
* the file will be validated everytime you save the file or you can do that manually by going to *Elbe->Validate*
* when you are ready to build your project you go to *Elbe->Build* project
* you can select outputfiles which will be downloaded directly after the build
* to delete a project you go to *File->Delete*, select the project you want to delete and confirm

	
Currently, only the versions 2.0 - 2.4 are fully supported. It might work with other versions but functionality is not guaranteed.  
	
Todo:
* create an initVM  from frontend
* right-click context menu
* multi-selection in delete dialog
